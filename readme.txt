[Task 4]: Successfully generated all the required capsules, transition,
and protocol for solving the problem of rock-paper-scissor using
the URML DSL language. The program is run and tested. The program
goes to the end condition and prints statement with the tag
"[Final Result]" indicating the game successfully finishes
and print the status of the game (win, lose or drawn)

[Task 5]: Here, we provide a functionality where a random number
is used for setting the value for the bestOf (i.e., total number of
rounds). Therefore, my program automatically handles the condition
if the bestOf = 2, it stops immediately after 2 rounds and
genere the following output with the tag "[Final Result]"
